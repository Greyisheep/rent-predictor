# Rent Predictor
This project helps people get started with pen source by makin contribution easier, but yet following best prectices as it is a relatable project. Rent predictor looks to help students with apartment serach as it provides search functions as well as easily accessible databases in form of spreadsheets. The model package gives in sights on prices of apartments in different areas to help students get an idea of what apartment prices in differnt areas are helping the student streamline their search location. As the data collection is open-source, it is easily accessible, usable and verifiable by the end users.
